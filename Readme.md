# **Load Posting and Bidding System**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a **Load Posting and Bidding System** that connects **shippers** and **truckers** efficiently.  
Shippers can post loads with details, and truckers can view, filter, and bid on loads based on their preferences.  
The system includes a **bidding mechanism** where the lowest bid wins, ensuring fair competition.  
Additionally, strict **eligibility criteria** for truckers help maintain security and reliability.
