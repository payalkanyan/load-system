# **Load Posting and Bidding System**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a **Load Posting and Bidding System** that connects **shippers** and **truckers** efficiently.  
Shippers can post loads with details, and truckers can view, filter, and bid on loads based on their preferences.  
The system includes a **bidding mechanism** where the lowest bid wins, ensuring fair competition.  
Additionally, strict **eligibility criteria** for truckers help maintain security and reliability.

## **Features**  

### **1. Load Posting System**  
- Shippers can post loads with details such as **pickup & drop-off locations, weight, type, and deadline**.  
- Truckers can browse, filter, and search loads based on **route and time preferences**.  

### **2. Bidding Mechanism**  
- Truckers **place bids** on loads.  
- The **lowest bid wins**, ensuring competitive pricing.
